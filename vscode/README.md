# New Relic CodeStream

Shift left by making code performance part of the earliest stages of the development process. 

- Get performance data for individual methods in the code, including notifications about poorly performing methods.
- Get actionable information, such as errors, vulnerabilities and non-compliant SLOs, for the services built from your code.
- Investigate errors more quickly by stepping through the stack trace and collaborating with teammates.

### Integrations

- **Issue Trackers:** Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Jira, Linear, Shortcut, Trello, YouTrack
- **Messaging Services:** Slack, Microsoft Teams

### Requirements

- CodeStream requires a current version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and is also available for [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream) or [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs-22).
- Your repository must be managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like GitHub or GitLab.

# Code-Level Metrics

See performance data, at the method level, right in your editor. Always-on view ensures that performance issues are factored into the work at hand. You can even see metrics for your lower environments, and head off performance issues before they hit production.

# Log Search

No need to slow down your investigation by context switching between your IDE and your browser to search logs. CodeStream brings the New Relic log-search experience right into your IDE! You can even search for output from specific log lines in your code.
