# New Relic CodeStream

Shift left by making code performance part of the earliest stages of the development process. 

- Get performance data for individual methods in the code, including notifications about poorly performing methods.
- Get actionable information, such as errors, vulnerabilities and non-compliant SLOs, for the services built from your code.
- Investigate errors more quickly by stepping through the stack trace and collaborating with teammates.

# Code-Level Metrics

See performance data, at the method level, right in your editor. Always-on view ensures that performance issues are factored into the work at hand. You can even see metrics for your lower environments, and head off performance issues before they hit production.
